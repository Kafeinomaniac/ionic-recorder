# ionic-recorder
Sound recording mobile / browser hybrid app, based on the Ionic framework and the Web Audio Interface.

## Introduction

This is an open-source project that intends to improve the code with the help of the community.

This app combines
* [Ionic 2.x](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/)
* [Web Audio Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and 
  [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API)
to build
* A simple recording app (hybrid app that can run either in your browser or as a native app - ios or android)
* Real-time recording quality stats and analysis


## Requirements
* Only a Firefox browser is supported currently because it's the only one that implements 
  [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API)
