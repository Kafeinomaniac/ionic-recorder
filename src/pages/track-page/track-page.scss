// note: we somehow need this, it's a hack. this fixes the issue
// of: when padding is on track page's ion-content, the outer border
// (the padded part) shows up black, becuase somehow a background: #fff
// is remembered.  putting this here fixes that and doesn't seem to have
// detrimental effects anywhere else
// .ios .ion-page.show-page~.nav-decor {
//     background: transparent;
